collective.flow
===============

Opinionated approach for building form workflow apps with Plone.

Developed primarily for in-house requirements.
Open sourced as proof-of-concept example.
Depends on venusianconfiguration.
Will not be released at PyPI, at least before 2.x release.

Intented to be used with Plone REST API and collective.webhook to
trigger RPA tasks with the reviewed data.
